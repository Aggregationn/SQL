Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 id
ii. Hours = 1562 business_id
iii. Category = 2643 business_id
iv. Attribute = 1115 business_id
v. Review = 9581 user_id
vi. Checkin = 493 business_id
vii. Photo = 6493 business_id
viii. Tip = 537 user_id 
ix. User = 10000 id
x. Friend = 11 user_id
xi. Elite_years = 2780 user_id

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
I chose Toronto and resturants
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
WORK IN PROGRESS

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
 Yes they do, the 2-3 star group has less overall and average reviews
 
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT
 COUNT(DISTINCT b.id)
 ,SUM(b.review_count)
 ,AVG (review_count)
 ,CASE
    WHEN stars >= 4.0 THEN '4-5 stars'
    WHEN stars >= 2.0 THEN '2-3 stars'
    ELSE '1 star'
    END AS star_range
FROM 
    business b 
    INNER JOIN category c 
    ON b.id = c.business_id
WHERE 
    b.city = 'Toronto' AND c.category = 'Restaurants'
    GROUP BY star_range
+----------------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------+
| COUNT(DISTINCT b.id) | SUM(b.review_count) | AVG (review_count) | star_range |
+----------------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------+
|                    1 |                   4 |                4.0 | 1 star     |
|                    4 |                  89 |              22.25 | 2-3 stars  |
|                    5 |                 206 |               41.2 | 4-5 stars  |
+----------------------+---------------------+--------------------+------------+
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
As far as I can tell the data has no patterns, every

SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT
DISTINCT(id)
 ,postal_code
 ,address
 ,neighborhood
 ,CASE
    WHEN stars >= 4.0 THEN '4-5 stars'
    WHEN stars >= 2.0 THEN '2-3 stars'
    ELSE '1 star'
    END AS star_range
FROM 
    business b 
    LEFT JOIN category c 
    ON b.id = c.business_id
WHERE 
    b.city = 'Toronto' AND c.category = 'Restaurants' address, neighborhood and postal code is different
    GROUP BY star_range, id

+------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+------------------------+------------+
| id                     | postal_code | address                  | neighborhood           | star_range |

+------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+------------------------+------------+
		
		
2. Group businesses based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
There is more open businesses than closed ones
         
ii. Difference 2:
There are more reviews on open businesses than closed ones
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT b.is_open, COUNT(b.id), SUM(b.review_count), AVG(stars)
FROM business b
INNER JOIN category c
ON b.id = c.business_id
GROUP BY is_open

+---------+-------------+---------------------+---------------+
| is_open | COUNT(b.id) | SUM(b.review_count) |    AVG(stars) |
+---------+-------------+---------------------+---------------+
|       0 |         122 |                4503 | 3.66393442623 |
|       1 |         574 |               32527 | 3.89982578397 |
+---------+-------------+---------------------+---------------+
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Current idea: something with the users and reviews, or attriubutes, alot of good stuff there
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
