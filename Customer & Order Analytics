#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
;

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT c.acctnum
FROM FebSales fs
INNER JOIN customers c 
ON c.order_id = fs.orderID
;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT product, MIN(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1
;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(price)*Quantity AS revenue, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM (price)*Quantity AS Revenue, Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product
;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT (c.acctnum), AVG (price*Quantity) as avg
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales fs
LEFT INNER JOIN customers c
ON fs.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE fs.Quantity > 2
;

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT SUM (Quantity), Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
